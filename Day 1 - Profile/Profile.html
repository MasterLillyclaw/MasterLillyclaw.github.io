  <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p class="margin"> I have played piano for about ten years, and I also enjoy reading, sleeping, eating, anime, YouTube, and gaming.
      I was largely involved in CSF, Key Club, FFA, ASB, and the Academic Decathlon during high school. </p>
    <p class="margin"> I'm a terrible gamer, so I spend most of my time watching people like Markiplier and Jacksepticeye on YouTube.
      My favorite game is Undertale, but I also have a game I enjoy called Gmod (Garry's Mod). </p>
    <p class="margin"> I also like to make bad puns, and I am very good at drawing very bad doodles. </p>

  <h2> Hometown </h2>
    <p><a href="http://cityofescalon.org">Escalon, California</a></p>

  <h2> University </h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a></p>
    <p class="margin"> I will be double majoring in CS and Classics in the college of Letters and Sciences.

  <h2> My Favorite Animes </h2>
    <p class="margin"> Honestly, I can't really list all of them, because there's so much anime I have seen that I love,
      and there's so much more that I haven't even seen yet. So here's a list of a few I enjoy.
