<h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>I am going to UC Berkeley this fall, and I plan on double majoring in CS and Classics.
    I have played piano for about ten years, and I also enjoy reading, sleeping, eating, anime, YouTube, and gaming.<br>
  <p>I'm a terrible gamer, so I spend most of my time watching people like Markiplier and Jacksepticeye on YouTube.
    My favorite game is Undertale, but I also have a game I enjoy called Gmod (Garry's Mod).<br>
  <p>I also like to make bad puns, and I am very good at drawing very bad doodles.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Animes</h2>
  <p>Honestly, I can't really list all of them, because there's so much anime I have seen that I love,
    and there's so much more that I haven't even seen yet. So here's a list of a few I enjoy.
